"""Lab 03 portfolio submission template.

Submit this single file to Gradescope once you've filled in the two
functions marked TODO below. Do not rename any of the functions - the
autograder looks them up by name.

What you need to do:
  1. Implement `lu_factorisation`. This must be your own implementation -
     do not import `scipy.linalg` or `sympy` or call a library
     decomposition routine; this exercise is assessed on your own
     implementation of the algorithm.
  2. Leave `row_add`/`gaussian_elimination` and `determinant` as given -
     they're provided code from the lab sheet, not something you write.
  3. Implement `runtime_comparison`. It must time your `lu_factorisation`
     against `gaussian_elimination` across a range of matrix sizes, produce
     a log-log plot of the two, and save it to "plot.png" in the working
     directory - the autograder looks for that exact filename.

    Compute the LU factorisation of a square matrix A.

    The function decomposes a square matrix ``A`` into the product of a lower
    triangular matrix ``L`` and an upper triangular matrix ``U`` such that:

    .. math::
        A = L U

    where ``L`` has unit diagonal elements and ``U`` is upper triangular.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : numpy.ndarray
        A 2D NumPy array of shape ``(n, n)`` representing the square matrix to
        factorise.

    Returns
    -------
    L : numpy.ndarray
        A lower triangular matrix with shape ``(n, n)`` and unit diagonal.

        An upper triangular matrix with shape ``(n, n)``.

def row_add(A, b, p, k, q):
    """
    Perform an in-place row addition operation on a linear system.

    This function applies the elementary row operation:

    ``row_p ← row_p + k * row_q``

    where `row_p` and `row_q` are rows in the coefficient matrix `A` and the
    right-hand side vector `b`. It updates the entries of `A` and `b`
    **in place**, directly modifying the original data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : numpy.ndarray
        A 2D NumPy array of shape ``(n, n)`` representing the coefficient matrix
        of the linear system.
    b : numpy.ndarray
        A 2D NumPy array of shape ``(n, 1)`` representing the right-hand side
        vector of the system.
    p : int
        The index of the row to be updated (destination row). Must satisfy
        ``0 <= p < n``.
    k : float
        The scalar multiplier applied to `row_q` before adding it to `row_p`.
    q : int
        The index of the source row to be scaled and added. Must satisfy

def gaussian_elimination(A, b):
    """
    Perform Gaussian elimination to reduce a linear system to upper triangular
    form.

    This function performs **forward elimination** to transform the coefficient
    matrix `A` into an upper triangular matrix, while applying the same
    operations to the right-hand side vector `b`. This is the first step in
    solving a linear system of equations of the form ``Ax = b`` using Gaussian
    elimination.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : numpy.ndarray
        A 2D NumPy array of shape ``(n, n)`` representing the coefficient matrix
        of the system.
    b : numpy.ndarray
        A 2D NumPy array of shape ``(n, 1)`` representing the right-hand side
        vector.

    -------
    None

        anything.
